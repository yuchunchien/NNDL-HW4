Neural Network and Deep Learning HW4

## Problem a
Implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and word embeddings with Airline Travel Information System (ATIS) dataset and achieve Spoken Language Understanding with Theano in Python.

## Problem b
Build a shallow MLP (2-layer), a deep MLP, a RNN, and a LSTM to learn the parity function with Theano in Python.
